Alternating Lines!
By Ma. Crista Ni√±a Ariosa

DSA
It's first day of class in DSA Academy! The students of Section A are very obedient, and they formed two lines, one for the boys, and one for the girls.

However, their teacher, Miss Q, wonders, "wouldn't it be nice if all of them formed an alternating line of boy, girl, and so on?"

As Miss Q's assistant, you started thinking up of a solution. You placed all the girls on the back of the boys' line, and worked your way from there. The challenge, now, is how will you alternate them from there?
